STEPS

Raise vm for salt master less

vagrant up


Salt Installation

curl -L https://bootstrap.saltstack.com -o install_salt.sh
sudo sh install_salt.sh -P
sudo service salt-minion stop


Minion Config[optional]

Copy the contents of file 'minion' in /etc/salt/minion


Create file_roots

sudo mkdir -p /srv/salt

sudo chmod 777 /srv/salt 


Top File

copy contents of top.sls in /srv/salt/top.sls


State

Copy contents of webserver.sls in /srv/salt/webserver.sls

Salt Call

sudo salt-call --local state.highstate   [If minion config is not done]
sudo salt-call state.highstate           [Otherwise]



Explanation

The minion first examines the top.sls file and determines that it is a part of
the group matched by * glob and that the webserver SLS should be applied.

It then examines the webserver.sls file and finds the nginx state, which
installs the Nginx package.
